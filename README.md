# React Native – Step by Step Learning Journey

This repository documents my **deep, step-by-step learning** of **React Native**.
It is not a single finished project, but a collection of **practice apps, experiments,
and small exercises** created while learning React Native fundamentals.

## Purpose of this Repository
- Learn React Native from basics to advanced concepts
- Practice by building small apps and features
- Understand concepts deeply instead of copying code
- Track my progress over time using Git commits

## What I Am Learning (Step by Step)
- React Native project structure
- Components and JSX
- `useState` and state management
- TouchableOpacity and user interactions
- Styling using `StyleSheet`
- Dynamic UI updates
- Android app setup and running apps
- Debugging and fixing errors

## Practice Apps Inside
- Color Changer App (background & rectangle colors)
- State handling experiments
- UI interaction practice

## Notes
- These apps are **learning exercises**, not production-ready projects
- Code may change frequently as I learn and refactor
- The focus is on understanding concepts, not perfection

## Tech Stack
- React Native
- JavaScript
- Android Emulator

📌 This repository represents my **learning process**, not just final results.
